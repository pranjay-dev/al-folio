I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Mechatronics Systems and Control Lab](http://msc.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://kaist.ac.kr/en/) advised by Prof. [Kyung-Soo Kim](http://msc.kaist.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=Professor&wr_id=8) and co-advised by Prof. [Kuk-Jin Yoon](http://vi.kaist.ac.kr/project/kuk-jin-yoon/). My research focuses on developing next-generation sensor fusion approaches for robust perception in autonomous systems having the characteristics,  
* Long Range Detection, Classification and Tracking of Objects of Interest.
* Consistent performance in adverse weather and illumination conditions. 
* Reduced requirement of annotated training datasets.
* Leveraging disjoint datasets for improving long tail performance


Towards this end I am researching on approaches that combines the principles of 
* Unsupervised and Self-Supervised Learning, 
* Image and Video Restoration and Enhancement
* Multi-Task Perception and 
* Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion and their fault-tolerant operation. 


I am currently serving as a reviewer for :
* [ICML-22](http://www.ijat.net/)
* [IJAT](http://www.ijat.net/)

and previously reviewed :
* [CVPR-22](https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com/)
* [ICRA-22](https://www.icra2022.org/)
